Please watch the YouTube video clips for a good understanding of Adam's strategy in news trading.

Additional videos showing trades automatically done by EA can be found in my YouTube Channel. Install the EA, goto "About" page and click on Copyright Link.

NOTE 1: Please do not request for source codes of EA.  You know why.  There are dishonest people who removed or changed copyright comments, compiled and sell them for a gain.
NOTE 2: Please ask for new expiry date if necessary.

Another acknowledgement:
IndFFCal.ex4 imports real time news calendar events from Forex Factory in XML format.  It is not written by me.  I just removed all the "heavy weights" payload to trim what is necessary for my EA.

Settings of EA can be found in attached pdf.

Installation :

1.  IndFFCal.ex4 - in Indicators folder
2.  FXNewsTrade.ex4 - in Expert Advisors folder
